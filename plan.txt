1. interfaces
- default methods
- static methods

2. abstract class vs interface

abstract class:
- can have non-public members (protected, package default, private)
- has constructor
- can extend other classes

interface
- ALL public members
- can have ONLY final fields (constants)
- can extend multiple interfaces

final fields:
- can be assigned ONLY ONCE!!!
- MUST BE assigned (in constructors, directly -> final String s = "abc")


3. multiple inheritance (by interfaces)
- diamond problem
- without and with default/static methods
